            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            The Islamic Center of Fayetteville (ICF) considers one of our 
            primary purposes to be to help both Muslims and non-Muslims 
            develop or improve their understanding of Islam.  
            In today’s world, misunderstanding Islam seems to be at the 
            core of many problems affecting Muslims and non-Muslims around 
            the world, and we believe that education and improved 
            understanding may go a long way toward reducing or eliminating 
            such problems.  Therefore, should you have any questions 
            that we may be able to address to help improve your understanding
            of this great way of life, please contact us by clicking the contact 
            us botton or by email at islamcentfay@yahoo.com.We are also available to speak with 
            your group or to meet with you individually to discuss this 
            topic.</div>

            <h3>Word of Wisdom</h3>
            As Salaam Alaikum, May Allah continue to Bless and Protect the Believers
            especially from the tremendous burden of shirk. At this time of year it is important 
            that we remember the freedom that tawheed brings to our lives as we remember: Qul huAllahu
            Ahad! Allahus Samad. Lam yalid wa lam yulad. Wa lam yahu qufuwan Ahad!
            The purity of these ayats are key to us keeping the reality of Esa ibn Maryam in perspective.
            Insha’Allah the following Khutbah will also serve as a reminder for us.</div>
